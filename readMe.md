Personal repository of [Advent of Code](#about-advent-of-code) 2020 solutions.


About Advent of Code
--------------------

[Advent of Code][https://adventofcode.com/2020/about] is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles
for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any
programming language you like. One programming puzzle a day is released from 1st
to 25th December, divided in two parts (the second of which is unlocked after
solving the first). Advent of Code is created by [Eric Wastl][aoc-eric], and is
100% free. If you like Advent Of Code and want to support its creator, you can
donate to him [here][aoc-support]. If you want to hang out with other fellow
coders, discuss about puzzles and solutions, or just have a look around, you can
join the official subreddit: [r/adventofcode][aoc-reddit], or the unofficial IRC
channel: `#adventofcode` on `irc.libera.chat`, where you can also find me at the
right time of the year.



About this repo
--------------------

I started to solve AOC exercises in the beginning of 2020 and still a long way to go.
Solutions will most likely not be the most efficient way to solve these exercises.
However they were the best I could come up with at the time.

If you have question or spotted a typo/bug/mistake or a more efficient way of solving a problem,
you are most welcome to [submit a new issue][new-issue].

Cheers
